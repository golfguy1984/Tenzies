# Tenzies

Tenzies is a fun game where users roll until all dice are the same. Clicking each die will freeze it at its current value between rolls. Players race against the timer as well as track there best score.

Tenzies is built with React. It makes use of React Hooks like useState and useEffect, props and conditional rendering to create the experience.
